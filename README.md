# Work-Day-Scheduler

A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. 

Date and Time are powered by the Dayjs library

# Usage

- Users will be able to enter tasks for each hour of normal business hours (9am - 5pm). After the users hit the corresponding save button to the right of the textbox area, the users info saves to local storage.
- The user key will log the hour and the day so the user "technically" doesn't have to reset the info for the next day but it will still be available to view in local storage in Dev tools. 

- If the user opens up the application anytime from 9am - 5pm, the textbox area will color code.
    - Grey represents the past
    - Red for the present
    - Green for the future

- The date on the top of the page updates automatically utilizing the Dayjs library.
